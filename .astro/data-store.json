How premium aesthetics drive conversion and trust.","Oct 24, 2025","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?q=80&w=1600&auto=format&fit=crop","## It’s not just about looking good.\n\nIn the boardroom, design is often treated as a subjective expense—something to make things \"look pretty\" after the real work is done. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the digital economy. In 2024, design is a capital asset that yields measurable returns.\n\nA study by Stanford University found that **75% of users admit to making judgments about a company’s credibility based on their website’s design**. If your digital storefront looks cheap, your product is assumed to be cheap.\n\n### The 50-Millisecond Rule\n\nResearch shows that it takes about 50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds) for users to form an opinion about your website that determines whether they’ll stay or leave. You cannot win a customer in that time, but you can certainly lose one.\n\nPremium design buys you time. It buys you the user's patience to actually read your headline and consider your offer.\n\n### Trust Signals and Perceived Value\n\nWhy does Apple charge a premium? Why does a bottle of Aesop soap cost $40? The ingredients are important, yes, but the **perceived value** is elevated through meticulous design.\n\nWhen we design for clients at Arkeon, we focus on three trust signals:\n1.  **Consistency:** Does the typography match the imagery? Is the spacing mathematical and predictable?\n2.  **Performance:** Does the interaction feel instant? Lag destroys trust.\n3.  **Hierarchy:** Is the path clear? A confused mind always says \"no.\"\n\n### The Conversion Correlation\n\nDesign is simply problem-solving. A well-designed interface removes friction. \n\n*   **Friction** is the enemy of conversion. \n*   **Clarity** is the driver of revenue.\n\nBy restructuring a landing page to follow user-experience (UX) best practices—clear contrast, readable type, and directive visual cues—we have seen conversion rates double without changing a single word of copy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStop viewing design as decoration. View it as infrastructure. Investing in premium design yields measurable returns in higher conversion rates, higher-value client inquiries, and a brand equity that compounds over time.","src/content/posts/roi-of-design.md","8efe7ec7b3eb7c4f",{"html":219,"metadata":220},"\u003Ch2 id=\"its-not-just-about-looking-good\">It’s not just about looking good.\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the boardroom, design is often treated as a subjective expense—something to make things “look pretty” after the real work is done.

We use **Recoleta** for headings to whisper elegance, heritage, and warmth, while utilizing **Inter** for body text to speak with modern, clean efficiency.\n\n### Readability vs. Legibility\n\nThere is a difference between being able to see letters (legibility) and wanting to read them (readability).\n\nWe obsess over:\n*   **Line Height:** Too tight, and the text feels cramped. Too loose, and the eye gets lost.\n*   **Line Length:** A line of text should be between 45 and 75 characters. Any longer, and the user's eye gets tired tracking back to the start of the next line.\n*   **Contrast:** Grey text on a white background might look \"aesthetic,\" but if it strains the eye, it fails.\n\n### Macro and Micro Typography\n\n**Macro typography** is the overall structure—how headlines interact with paragraphs and whitespace. This guides the user down the page.\n\n**Micro typography** is the detail—kerning (space between letters), ligatures, and using real quote marks (“”) instead of inch marks (\").\n\nThese details are invisible to the average user, but they feel the difference.
